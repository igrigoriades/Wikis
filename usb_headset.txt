Edit the /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-output.conf.common 
file as root

[Element PCM]
switch = mute
volume = ignore
volume-limit = 0.01
override-map.1 = all 
override-map.2 = all-left,all-right

Note that the value 0.01 can be adjusted as needed to change how quiet and loud the volume is. 
Making the number smaller reduces the max volume while making the number larger increases the max volume.
