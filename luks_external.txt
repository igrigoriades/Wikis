How to automount and autodecrypt secondary disks on Linux
---------------------------------------------------------
Using luks and assuming already encrypted
---------------------------------------------------------
I could tell you how to create a keyfile and unlock the drive
then using fstab and crypttub and bla bla bla
But NO!

0.0		Open gnome-disks
0.1		If gnome-disks not installed; install it
1.0		Select your drive from the left panel	 
	1.1 Click the gear icon 
	1.2 Uncheck the User Session Defaults
	1.3 Check unlock at system startup
	1.4 Enter the passphrase 
2.0 	Click on that gear again
	2.1 select mount otions
	2.2 Uncheck the User Session Defaults
	2.3 Enter the desired location

Mind that:
	* You propably have to change the ownership of the directory using  
	  sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /dir_path
	* This method will create a file on your system with the passphrase of the 
	  drive you want to mount
	* Please consider using full disk encryption on your boot drive :)
